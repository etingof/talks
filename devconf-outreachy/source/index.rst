==========================================

Presented by: Aija Jauntēva, Dmitry Tantsur, Richard Pioso, Ilya Etingof

In this talk
------------

* What is Outreachy internship
* How it worked out for us & lessons learned
* Should you try it too?

.. Things to talk about ^ (ietingof)

In our talk we will explain what the Outreachy program is all about,
why we decided to participate in it.

We will tell about our experience and lessons learned.

Finally, we will think aloud why this program may or may not be
for you.

Why we do this
--------------

* To help breeding software engineers
* Sustain the open source culture

.. Things to talk about ^ (ietingof)

  Much like in medieval European trade guilds (or even now days science),
  software engineering seems to require some kind of apprenticeship before
  one can get hold of the profession.

  As breeding and sustaining open source software is part of the Red Hat
  business strategy, attracting and growing open source engineers lines-up
  well with company's goals.

  Beyond that, we are the open source engineers ourselves. It is in our
  immediate interest to sustain and promote the culture we enjoy and being
  part of.

What is OpenStack
-----------------

* Decade-old open source community project
* Has involved 1025 developers from 126 companies
* Made out of 728 repos

.. Things to talk about ^ (rpioso)

  OpenStack is a large and well-established, highly collaborative open source
  software engineering project. At OpenStack, we crave quality engineering
  practices, mutual respect and continuous learning.

  The goal of the OpenStack project is to create and maintain free and open
  source cloud management software.

  If we look at Stacklytics for the current (Stein) cycle, the basic stats can
  be seen on the slide.

About Outreachy
---------------

What is Outreachy:

  * Volunteer organization under Software Freedom Conservancy.
  * Brings together the interns, the mentors and the code
  * Promotes diversity and free software

How it works:

  * Interns get on-board open source projects
  * Each intern gets a mentor (or two)
  * 3 month paid internship

.. Things to talk about ^ (ietingof)

  Outreachy is a volunteer organization operating under the Software Freedom
  Conservancy umbrella.

  Outreachy helps ends meeting: interns, mentors and the open source projects
  that seek contributors and mentors.

  The main focus of Outreachy is to promote and ensure diversity, getting
  different people from all over the world to join the open source bandwagon.

Why being an intern
-------------------

* To find your aspirations
* To learn the software engineering craft
* Start contributing to free and open source software
* To get a job (hopefully, the dream one)

.. Things to talk about ^ (Aija)

  There might be many reasons for young people to consider Outreachy
  internship.

  Taking part in large-scale software development could help a person to
  understand if software engineering career would be a good fit for them.

  For the greenhorn engineers, being on the team with the masters of craft,
  works like an medieval apprenticeship and helps interns to grow.

  For people with some background in software engineering, this can help
  to get started contributing to free and opensource software which they
  have not tried already for different reasons.

  Finally, having worked on a highly-visible open source project helps
  building a digital trace to prove their worthiness to the prospective
  employers.

Why mentoring with @Outreachy
-----------------------------

* To contribute back to the culture we are part of
* Helps improve professionally and personally
* Get more hands on our stuff

.. Things to talk about ^ (dtantsur)

  One reason for being a mentor is to contribute back to the community which shaped
  us - the grown up programmers.

  We are the products of this culture, we need to sustain it to stay happy.

  Meeting new and diverse people help us to improve personally.

  Teaching can be quite rewarding - we learn new things, we explain them.

  Finally, Outreachy brings motivated and productive contributors to our projects.

Aija's Internship @OpenStack
----------------------------

* How it all begun

  - finding a project

     - something new, but in familiar programming language
     - mentors in similar time zone

* The initial application:

  - Challenges

    - initial ticket
    - transparency of other applying

  - Successes

    - dedicated tickets for application

.. Things to talk about ^ (Aija)

  my background: a full-stack web developer in enterprise information systems
  using Java and C#. Used FOSS for personal needs.

  Criteria to filter initial list. Try something new that haven't done before.
  Best chances with projects in Python that have used in personal projects.

  Similar time zone to avoid waiting for hours if get stuck with something.
  If wouldn't be able to find the project using all criteria, this would be dropped.

  OpenStack project matching all criteria.

  Choice of the ticket was not successful - in the end it did not result in any code,
  but only documentation updates.
  Seemed that best tickets were already taken.

  Visibility of other people applying and how they are going. New applicant appearing
  after application deadline extended.

  Despite the challenges of initial ticket,
  dedicated tickets still a good starting point.

OpenStack: everybody struggles
------------------------------

* Technology

  - Code complexity and its sheer size is overwhelming
  - The developer's workbench takes time to learn
  - Not always possible to run OpenStack at home

* Social

  - Code reviews tend to be slow
  - Sometimes feedback can look harsh
  - Newcomers are prone to taking the feedback personally
  - It takes time become a good community citizen

.. Things to talk about ^ (dtantsur)

Outreachy application period
----------------------------

In the eyes of a mentor:

* Come up with isolated, yet non-trivial and useful tasks
* On-board a handful of candidates to let them proceed
* Pondering code reviews aiming to merge their work

.. Things to talk about ^ (ietingof)

  According to the program policies, during the application period
  prospective interns should prove their worthiness by doing some
  accountable work.

  Once the application period is over, the mentors are to rank
  all successful applicants and Outreachy organizers will work
  on figuring out the budget.

  Seasonal coding is not easy with OpenStack because... it's
  OpenStack (see previous slide).

  But we managed to come up with a bunch of isolated coding tasks
  and let the candidates chose and assign them to themselves.

Aija's survival hints
---------------------

* Code reviews

  - Don't take it personally (really don't)
  - But take responsibility for the code you write
  - Essential part of programming
  - Opportunity to learn

* Asking questions

* Working from home/remotely

  - Self-starter
  - Motivation
  - Dedicated place to work
  - Video calls

.. Things to talk about ^ (Aija)

  Code reviews very demanding and questioning every single bit.

  "You are not your code" - aware not to take this personally.

  Avoiding opposite extreme - not taking responsibility for the code

  Important part of software development, still productive time if
  not writing new code actively.

  Learned and researched new things
  even if they did not make to submitted version.

  Finding a balance when to ask for help - is it too soon or should
  try to figure out yourself.

  Working outside the regular office might be challenging. Need to have
  right motivation and environment. Separate work form leisure and
  leisure from work.
  Regular calls for synchronous/instant communication.

Case study: reaching out for the industry
-----------------------------------------

* Industry is influential
* Silos exist
* How we figured out our stuff

.. Things to talk about ^ (rpioso)

  Industry is heavily involved in OpenStack and is highly influential when
  it comes to standardization.

  At the same time, feedback loop may not always be ideal e.g. standards may
  be confusing or lacking features.

  Finally, the young engineers may be hesitant to reach out for the
  technical "officials".

  So we helped bringing down the silos between the manufacturers, standards
  body and the open source community though the internship. Here is how our
  story unfolded:

  * Aija worked on a new protocol implementation for OpenStack/ironic which
    has not been fully standardized
  * A couple of confusion points arose
  * Aija has reached out for Dell - the hardware manufacturer implementing
    the same protocol on the hardweare side
  * Dell engineers set up Aija with DMTF to clarify the technical matters
  * Aija's experience has been fed back to the standards organization what:

    - Helped to clarify and improve the technicalities of the standard
    - Set up the ties between the computer manufacturer's engineers,
      OpenStack engineers and the standards organization
    - Taught Aija to negotiate intricate and complicated technical matters
      with fellow engineers
    - Proved that this internship has been successful

How to be a better mentor
-------------------------

Work-wise:

* Keep your intern busy, challenged and growing
* Help keeping them focused to get things done
* Build on small successes, plan and promote small steps

Community:

* Network interns with the upstream community
* Involve interns in code reviews

Psychologically:

* Understand the psychological setting, be aware of the biases
* Consider being a co-researcher with your intern, rather than a
  master-apprentice
* Promote friendliness, awesomeness and curiosity

.. Things to talk about ^ (dtantsur)

  Mentorship can be difficult, but rewarding.

  You are likely to stay engaged with the intern on a daily basis,
  making sure they are not stuck and keep challenged. This requires
  time and dedication.

  Considering the many moving parts in OpenStack, it is easy to get
  distracted from one project to the other. This is also prompted
  by long-pending reviews. Keep the intern focused on their goals
  is one of the things to keep an eye on.

  Good mentors should help intern to network with community
  through IRC chat, code reviews. Building community is the goal
  here.

  Being remote, it may be hard to read intern's mind. We, humans, are
  good at building the substitute for the insufficient perception
  with our biases. That's a thing to stay away from.

  No matter how experienced one could be, there will always be areas
  in the contemporary technology where the mentors may not know much.
  Therefore sometimes we think of the mentorship as of a research
  collaboration, not so much as a benevolent master / submissive
  apprentice kind of interaction.

  After all, the internship should be a positive and fun experience.

Signs of a successful intern
----------------------------

* Has a track record of playing with computers
* Researched the project they apply
* Reasonable expectations e.g. open source quirks

.. Things to talk about ^ (ietingof)

  It seems that if a person is genuinely interested in the technology, that
  is not only as a prospective profession, but just for the sake of it - that
  is a promising sign.

  When they come well-prepared understanding what this project is all
  about and why it might be a good match for them - that's another good
  sign. At best, they are hoping to stay with the project after the
  internship is over.

  Finally, one can't be too sensitive when it comes to the way open source
  community works. For instance: feedback can hurt, your work could be
  abandoned or reshaped in a way you do not like. So it's best to see the
  applicant understanding the potential for such development.
