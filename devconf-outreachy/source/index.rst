==========================================

Presented by:

* Aija Jauntēva (intern)
* Dmitry Tantsur (mentor)
* Richard Pioso (industry engineer)
* Ilya Etingof (mentor)

In this talk
------------

* What is Outreachy internship?
* How it worked out for us & lessons learned
* Should you try it, too?

.. Things to talk about ^ (ietingof)

  In our talk, we will explain what the Outreachy program is all about,
  and why we decided to participate in it.

  We will share our experience and lessons learned.

  Finally, we will think aloud why this program may or may not be
  for you.

Why do we do this?
------------------

* Help develop software engineers
* Sustain the open source culture
* Promote diversity in the profession

.. Things to talk about ^ (ietingof)

  Much like in medieval European trade guilds (or even nowadays science),
  software engineering seems to require some kind of apprenticeship before
  one can attain professional proficiency.

  As creating and sustaining open source software is part of the Red Hat
  business strategy, attracting and growing open source engineers lines up
  well with the company's goals.
  
.. Things to talk about ^ (rpioso)

  Promoting diversity is a core part of OpenStack, Dell EMC, and Red Hats'
  cultures. Not only is that the right thing to do, diverse teams produce
  superior software and business results.

.. Things to talk about ^ (ietingof)

  Beyond that, we are open source engineers ourselves. It is in our direct
  interest to sustain and promote the culture we enjoy being a part of.

What is OpenStack?
------------------

* Cloud management software stack and infrastruture software
* Decade-old open source community project
* Has involved 1025 developers from 126 companies
* Made out of 728 repos

Reference: https://docs.openstack.org/project-team-guide/introduction.html
Reference: https://www.stackalytics.com, Stein cycle

.. Things to talk about ^ (rpioso)

  OpenStack is a large, well-established, and highly collaborative open source
  software engineering project. At OpenStack, we crave quality engineering
  practices, mutual respect, and continuous learning.

  The goal of the OpenStack project is to create and maintain free and open
  source cloud management and infrastructure software.
  
  The first reference offers a bit of OpenStack history and the second briefly
  defines "The OpenStack Way", which are its four opens -- Open Source, Open
  Design, Open Development, and Open Community.

  If we look at Stacklytics for the current release cycle (Stein), the basic
  stats can be seen on the slide.

About Outreachy
---------------

What is Outreachy?

  * Non-profit project under Software Freedom Conservancy
  * Brings together interns, mentors, community and free software projects
  * Promotes the participation of under represented persons in technology
    fields

How does it work?

  * Interns gets into an open source project
  * Each intern gets a mentor (or two)
  * 3 month paid internship

.. Things to talk about ^ (ietingof)

  Outreachy is a non-profit project operating under the Software Freedom
  Conservancy umbrella.

  Outreachy helps bring together interns, mentors, and open source projects
  that seek contributors and mentors.
  
  Helps promote not only open source but also 4 open principles of OpenStack

  The main focus of Outreachy is to promote and ensure diversity, getting
  different people from all over the world to join the open source movement.

Why become an intern?
---------------------

* Find your aspirations
* Learn the software engineering, documentation, design, or other craft
* Start contributing to free and open source software
* Get a job (hopefully, the dream one)

.. Things to talk about ^ (Aija)

  There are many reasons for young people to consider Outreachy internship.

  It can help people with some background in information technology fields,
  including programming, user experience, documentation, graphical design,
  marketing, etc., get started contributing to free and open source software, which
  they may not have previously tried for a variety of reasons.

  Taking part in large-scale software development could help a person to
  understand if a software engineering career would be a good fit for them.

  For greenhorn engineers, being on a team with masters of the craft works
  like a medieval apprenticeship and helps interns to grow.

  Finally, working on a highly visible open source project helps build a
  digital portfolio to demonstrate one's worthiness to prospective employers.

Why mentor with @Outreachy?
---------------------------

* Contribute back to the culture we are part of
* Grow professionally and personally
* Get more hands on our stuff

.. Things to talk about ^ (dtantsur)

  One reason for being a mentor is to contribute back to the community which shaped
  us - the grown up programmers.

  We are the products of this culture, and need to sustain it to stay happy.

  Meeting new and diverse people helps us to improve personally.

  Teaching can be quite rewarding - we learn new things when we explain them.
  
  Teaching open culture not just open code

  Finally, Outreachy brings motivated and productive contributors to our projects.

Aija's internship @OpenStack
----------------------------

* How it all began

  - Finding a project

     - something new, but in familiar programming language
     - mentors in the same or nearby time zone

* The initial application:

  - Challenges

    - initial ticket
    - transparency in seeing others applying

  - Successes

    - dedicated tickets for application

.. Things to talk about ^ (Aija)

  My background: a full-stack web developer in enterprise information systems,
  using Java and C#. Used FOSS for personal needs.

  Criteria to filter initial list. Try something new that I hadn't done before.
  Best chances with projects in Python, which I had used in personal projects.

  Similar time zone to avoid waiting for hours if get stuck with something.
  If unable to find a project meeting all of the criteria, this would be dropped.

  OpenStack project matched all of my criteria.

  Choice of the ticket was not successful - in the end it did not result in any code,
  but only documentation updates.
  It seemed the best tickets were already taken.

  Visibility of other people applying and how they are doing. New applicant appeared
  after application deadline was extended.

  Despite the challenges of initial ticket, dedicated tickets are still a good
  starting point.

OpenStack: Everybody struggles
------------------------------

* Technology

  - Code complexity and its sheer size is overwhelming
  - Developer's workbench takes time to learn
  - Not always possible to run OpenStack at home

* Social

  - Code reviews tend to be slow
  - Sometimes feedback can seem harsh
  - Newcomers are prone to taking the feedback personally
  - It takes time to become egoless and a good community citizen

.. Things to talk about ^ (dtantsur)

Outreachy application period
----------------------------

In the eyes of a mentor:

* Come up with isolated, yet non-trivial and useful tasks
* On-board a handful of candidates to let them proceed
* Ponder code reviews, aiming to merge their work
* Ensure the community is on board with your effort

.. Things to talk about ^ (ietingof)

  According to the program policies, during the application period,
  prospective interns should prove their worthiness by doing some
  accountable work.

  Once the application period is over, the mentors are to rank
  all successful applicants and Outreachy organizers work on
  figuring out the budget.

  Seasonal coding is not easy with OpenStack because ... it's
  OpenStack (see previous slide).

  On top of that, we need to reach consensus with the upstream team
  on the proposed work.

  In the end, we managed to come up with a bunch of isolated coding
  tasks and let the candidates chose and assign them to themselves.

Aija's survival hints
---------------------

* Code reviews

  - Don't take it personally (really don't)
  - But take responsibility for the code you write
  - Essential part of programming
  - Opportunity to learn

* Asking questions

* Working from home/remotely

  - Self-starter
  - Motivation
  - Dedicated place to work
  - Video calls

.. Things to talk about ^ (Aija)

  Code reviews are very demanding and question every single bit.

  "You are not your code" - beware not to take it personally.

  Avoid the opposite extreme, not taking responsibility for the code.

  Important part of software development. Still productive time, even
  if not actively writing new code.

  Learned and researched new things, some of which did not make it
  into submitted contributions.

  Finding a balance when to ask for help -- Is it too soon? Should I
  try to figure it out myself?

  Working outside the regular office may be challenging. Need to have
  right motivation and environment. Separate work from leisure and
  leisure from work.
  Regular calls for synchronous/instant communication.

Case study: Becoming better together
------------------------------------

* Industry is influential in OpenStack and standards bodies
* Silos existed between OpenStack, a standards body, and industry
* How we came together to everyone's benefit

Reference: https://www.dmtf.org
Reference: https://www.dmtf.org/standards/redfish
Reference: https://docs.openstack.org/ironic/latest/

.. Things to talk about ^ (rpioso)

  Industry is heavily involved in OpenStack and highly influential in
  standardization efforts.

  The standards body in this story is the Distributed Management Task Force
  (DMTF), which creates open standards for managing IT infrastructure. One of
  its newer and evolving standards is Redfish, a RESTful API for simply and
  securely managing converged, hybrid IT and the software-defined data
  center. The DMTF Redfish Forum, which performs the standard's technical
  work, was interested in promoting its use in open source.
  
  Separately, OpenStack's Ironic project was implementing support for Redfish
  to provision and life-cycle manage bare metal servers. Its developers, including Aija, were
  facing challenges, and found the standard's specifications and related
  documentation not always ideal, e.g., confusing or lacking detail. Go
  figure!

  And the industry vendors, including Dell EMC, are contributing to both
  Redfish and Ironic. They introduced the DMTF Redfish Forum and Ironic
  leaders to one another and helped establish a collaboration among all three
  communities.
  
  In the trenches writing the code was Aija. Like many young engineers, she
  may have felt hesitant to reach out to the technical "officials". Now they
  were working alongside her on a shared goal.

  Aija's experience has been fed back to the Redfish Forum about what:

  * helped to clarify and improve the technicalities of the standard,
  * set up the ties between the computer manufacturer's engineers, OpenStack
    engineers, and standards organization, and
  * taught Aija to negotiate intricate and complicated technical matters with
    fellow engineers

  Through Aija's successful Outreachy internship, three communities --
  industry, a standards body, and an open source community -- tore down silos
  to come together and jointly further one another's goals.

How to be a better mentor
-------------------------

Work-wise:

* Keep your intern busy, challenged, and growing
* Help keep them focused to get things done
* Build on small successes, plan and promote small steps

Community:

* Help network interns with the upstream community
* Involve interns in code reviews

Psychologically:

* Understand the psychological setting, be aware of the biases
* Consider being a co-researcher with your intern, rather than a
  master-apprentice
* Promote friendliness, awesomeness, and curiosity

.. Things to talk about ^ (dtantsur)

  Mentorship can be difficult, but rewarding.

  You are likely to stay engaged with the intern on a daily basis,
  making sure they are not stuck and remain challenged. This requires
  time and dedication.

  Considering the many moving parts in OpenStack, it is easy to get
  distracted from one project to the other. This is also prompted
  by long running reviews. Keeping the intern focused on their goals
  is one of the things to focus on.

  Good mentors should help interns to network with the community
  through IRC chat and code reviews. Building community is the goal
  here.

  Being remote, it may be hard to read the intern's mind. We humans
  are good at using our biases to build a substitute for
  insufficient perception. That's a thing to stay away from.

  No matter how experienced one may be, there will always be areas
  in contemporary technology in which the mentors may not know much.
  Therefore, sometimes we think of the mentorship as a research
  collaboration, not so much as a benevolent master / dutiful
  apprentice kind of interaction.

  After all, the internship should be a positive and fun experience.

Signs of a successful intern
----------------------------

* Has a track record of playing with computers
* Researched the project they applied to
* Reasonable expectations, e.g., open source quirks

.. Things to talk about ^ (ietingof)

  It seems it's a promising sign when a person is genuinely interested in
  the technology, not only as a prospective profession, but just for the
  sake of it,

  When they come well prepared understanding what the project is all
  about and why it might be a good match for them, that's another good
  sign. At best, they hope to stay with the project after the internship
  is over.

  Finally, one can't be too sensitive when it comes to the way the open
  source community works. For instance, feedback can hurt and your work
  could be abandoned or reshaped in a way you do not like. So, it's best
  to see the applicant understanding the potential for such development.
