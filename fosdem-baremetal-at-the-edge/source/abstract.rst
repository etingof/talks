Abstract
--------

Deploying bare metal machines at the edge of the cloud may not play well with
conventional PXE protocol suite. In this presentation we will explain how the
emerging virtual media boot technology could significantly improve scalability,
reliability and security of the Cloud.

In this talk, the latest advancements in bare metal provisioning service
(ironic) will be explained and PXE-less machine deployment will be demonstrated
showcasing two scenarios - bare metal management within the OpenStack cloud and
a stand-alone ironic use-case (e.g. within a container orchestration system).
